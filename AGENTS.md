## Embedding API

```rust
use epsh::eval::Shell;
use epsh::parser::Parser;
use epsh::builtins::{is_builtin, BUILTIN_NAMES};

// Builder pattern — recommended for embedders
let mut shell = Shell::builder()
    .cwd(PathBuf::from("/project"))
    .errexit(true)
    .pipefail(true)
    .noglob(true)
    .noexec(false)
    .stdout_sink(stdout.clone())
    .stderr_sink(stderr.clone())
    .cancel_flag(cancel.clone())
    .timeout(Duration::from_secs(120))
    .env_clear()
    .build();

// Parse once, execute separately (for permission checking)
let program = Parser::new("echo hello").parse().unwrap();
let status = shell.run_program(&program);

// Custom process spawner (for sandboxing, job control, SSH proxy)
shell.set_external_handler(Box::new(|argv, prefix_assignments| {
    // argv[0] is the command name; prefix_assignments are variable assignments
    // redirections already applied to file descriptors;
    // epsh::eval::external_command_cwd() is the shell's working directory
    todo!("spawn the process your way")
}));

// Optional: own the open(2) of writable redirections (>, >|, >>, <>).
// Return None to keep epsh's default open, or the descriptor you opened
// with exactly the requested semantics (for example after preserving the
// existing file). Earlier redirections are restored if one fails.
shell.set_redirect_open_handler(Box::new(|request| {
    let _ = (request.path, request.mode, request.fd);
    None
}));

// Interactive shell primitives
let mut ish = Shell::builder()
    .interactive(true)           // enables tcsetpgrp + WUNTRACED
    .external_handler(handler)   // you own fork/exec/wait
    .build();
// ShellError::Stopped { pid, pgid } propagates when a process is stopped

// Builtin detection for permission systems / prompt coloring
assert!(is_builtin("echo"));
assert!(!is_builtin("rm"));
```

## Testing

```sh
cargo test
cargo test --test api_stability                         # API surface regression
cargo test --test embedding                             # embedding API tests
cargo test --test integration                           # shell behavior tests
cargo build && perl check.pl -p ./target/debug/epsh \
  -s check-epsh.t                                       # mksh conformance
sh tests/stress/run.sh ./target/debug/epsh dash         # performance vs dash
perl filter-tests.pl check.t > check-epsh.t             # regenerate filtered tests
```

## Performance vs dash

Fork-dominated operations (typical coding agent workload) are at parity:

| Operation | vs dash | Technique |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| Builtin command substitution | **3.6x faster** | Fork-free `$(echo ...)` |
| Heredocs | **0.8x** | Faster than dash |
| Pipelines | **1.1x** | posix_spawn, exec-direct |
| External commands | **1.1x** | At parity |
| Tight arith loops | ~28x | String allocation dominated |

The arith loop gap requires integer variable representation (dash's approach).

## Design Lineage — What We Actually Took

The original plan drew from three reference shells. Here's what we ended up
using, what we adapted, and where we diverged.

### From dash (primary — semantics and behavior)

dash is the conformance target. We ported these mechanisms directly:

- **EV_TESTED errexit model** (`eval.rs`): Only leaf nodes (Simple, Pipeline, Subshell)
  trigger `set -e` exit. Compound nodes propagate status but never exit directly.
  The `tested` flag suppresses errexit in if/while/until conditions and `&&`/`||`
  left operands. Matches `eval.c` lines 246-330.

- **pgetc_eatbnl** (`lexer.rs`): `peek()` and `advance()` transparently consume
  `\<newline>` continuations. `peek_raw()`/`advance_raw()` for single-quote and
  heredoc body contexts. Comments use raw reading.

- **parsesub syntax context** (`lexer.rs`): `read_brace_param` passes `in_dquote`
  to `read_brace_word_parts`. Trim ops (`%`, `#`) force BASESYNTAX (single quotes
  are quoting). Default/assign/alt (`-`, `+`, `=`, `?`) inherit context. Inner `"`
  in dquote `${…}` toggles context (dash's `innerdq`).

- **Heredoc reading at newlines** (`parser.rs`): `read_pending_heredocs` called
  after newline consumption in both `parse_program` and `parse_command_list`.
  Matches dash's `parseheredoc()` in `readtoken()`.

- **in_forked_child optimization** (`eval.rs`): Subshells inside pipeline children
  execute directly without double-forking. Prevents pipe fd leaks. Mirrors dash's
  `EV_EXIT` fast-path in `evalsubshell`.

- **IO_NUMBER detection** (`parser.rs`): Digit-only unquoted words before `<`/`>`
  parsed as fd numbers, not arguments.

- **Arithmetic noeval** (`arith.rs`): Ternary `?:` and `&&`/`||` suppress side
  effects (assignments) on non-taken branches via `noeval` flag. Matches dash's
  `arith_yacc.c`.

- **preglob/RMESCAPE_GLOB** (`expand.rs`): `expand_pattern()` escapes glob
  metacharacters from quoted regions for fnmatch. Used by trim ops and case patterns.

- **Heredoc body rules** (`parser.rs`, `lexer.rs`): Unquoted heredocs use DQSYNTAX
  (single quotes literal, `"` literal, only `\$` `\`` `\\` `\<nl>` are special
  backslash escapes). `\<newline>` continuation with odd/even backslash counting.

### From posh (IFS and expansion)

- **IFS field-splitting state machine** (`expand.rs`): Single-pass `field_split`
  distinguishes IFS whitespace vs non-whitespace. Handles empty fields between
  non-WS delimiters, leading/trailing WS stripping. Adopted as designed.

- **in_param_word flag** (`expand.rs`): Literals inside `${var+word}` etc. are
  marked `split_fields: true` when in unquoted context. This was our adaptation
  of posh's SubType stack concept — we don't have a stack, but the flag achieves
  the same per-context splitting behavior.

- **Variable scope stack** (`var.rs`): `push_scope()`/`pop_scope()` with saved
  values for `local`. Inspired by posh's environment stacking, implemented with
  Rust's RAII-friendly design.

### From mrsh (AST design and API)

- **Span on every AST node** (`ast.rs`): Source position tracking for error
  reporting. Used in ShellError::Syntax and ShellError::Runtime.

- **word_break metadata** (`expand.rs`): `ExpandedWord` carries `word_break: bool`
  to mark `"$@"` field boundaries, keeping arguments separate through field splitting.

- **Library-first architecture**: `Shell` struct with `run_script`, `set_var`,
  `get_var` API. The binary is a thin CLI wrapper.

### Where We Diverged

- **Single-pass WordPart building** — we started with mrsh's two-phase approach
  (lexer collects raw text, parser re-parses into WordParts) but hit a wall of
  quoting-context bugs at ~74% conformance. We restructured to build WordParts
  directly during lexing (matching dash's single-pass model) while keeping
  mrsh's typed enum representation instead of dash's control-character-in-string
  approach. This was the highest-impact architectural change.

- **ExitStatus newtype** — neither dash, posh, nor mrsh distinguish exit codes
  at the type level. Our `ExitStatus(i32)` with named constants (`SUCCESS`,
  `FAILURE`, `MISUSE`, `NOT_FOUND`, `NOT_EXECUTABLE`) and `from_wait()` prevents
  integer confusion throughout the codebase.

- **Expansion returns Result** — dash uses setjmp/longjmp, posh uses longjmp,
  mrsh uses return codes. We use `Result<T, ShellError>` with the `?` operator,
  which gives us dash-equivalent error propagation with Rust's type safety.
  BadSubst, `${var?msg}`, and arithmetic errors all propagate cleanly.

- **`$(<file)` optimization** — reads the file directly without forking, since
  we can detect the pattern (Simple command with no args/assigns, one input
  redirect) before entering the fork path.

## Interactive Shell Support

epsh doesn't implement interactive features directly, but provides the minimal
primitives for an interactive shell to be built on top:

- **`ExternalHandler`**: callback replacing fork+exec for external commands.
  The embedder owns process creation for job control and terminal management.
- **`interactive` mode**: `tcsetpgrp` gives pipeline foreground, `WUNTRACED`
  detects stopped processes, `ShellError::Stopped { pid, pgid }` carries
  the pipeline PGID for job resume.
- **`BUILTIN_NAMES`**: for prompt coloring and completion.

Everything else (prompt, history, line editing, `fg`/`bg`/`jobs`) is the
interactive shell's responsibility.

## Agent Discoverability and Shell Terminology

Coding agents navigate by filenames and text search. Keep names distinctive,
use one spelling per concept, and put important explanations above the
definitions they describe. Name tests after the source or behavior they cover;
update definitions, call sites, tests, and docs together during renames.

Use shell terms precisely:

- A token is a lexical unit; a shell word is an unexpanded sequence of word
  parts; a field is an argument produced after expansion.
- A simple command has assignments, a command name, arguments, and redirections.
- A pipeline joins commands with `|`; an AND-OR list uses `&&` or `||`; a
  sequential list uses `;` or a newline. Use list as the umbrella term.
- Parameter expansion handles `$HOME`; pathname expansion, or globbing, handles
  `*.rs`; command substitution handles `$(...)` and backticks.
- A builtin runs in the shell; an external command runs through the external
  handler or default process executor.

`epsh` may parse more constructs than an embedding application exposes. Treat
the embedding contract and tests as authoritative, not the dependency's full
parser capability.

## Known Limitations

- Signal traps fire between commands but not during blocking waits
- `~user` expansion requires getpwnam (not available stdlib-only)
- Arith loops ~28x slower than dash (string allocation; fixable with integer var repr)

## What's Not Implemented (by design)

- Job control builtins (fg, bg, jobs) — use `external_handler` + `Stopped`
- Interactive features (prompt, history, line editing) — use rustyline/reedline
- Aliases
- Here-strings (`<<<`)
- Extended globs (`@(...)`, `+(...)`, etc.)
- Arrays, typeset, select (ksh extensions)
