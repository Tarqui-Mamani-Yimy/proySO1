# epsh

Embeddable POSIX shell.

It primarily exists so that Rust-based coding agents can execute shell commands in-process rather
than shelling out to bash. It's a library first, binary second.

It's not an interactive shell, but an interactive shell could be built on top of it.

## Why not just use bash?

Spawning bash works, but it gives you no control. You can't cancel a
runaway command without killing the process group yourself. You can't
capture output without pipe gymnastics. You can't run two commands with
different working directories in the same process. You can't inspect the
AST before execution for permission checking.

epsh gives you all of that as a Rust API.

## Why not an existing shell library?

Existing embeddable shells either target interactive use (and carry the
complexity of job control, line editing, history, SIGTSTP handling) or are
POSIX-incomplete. epsh takes the opposite approach: **strip out everything
interactive and get the scripting semantics right**.

No job control. No prompt. No aliases. No history. No terminal handling.
This eliminates entire categories of bugs and reduces the surface to what
a coding agent actually needs: run a script, get the output, check the
exit code.

## At a glance

- **dash conformance** on the mksh test suite
- **Builder API** — configure shell options, sinks, timeouts, and cancellation in one builder sequence
- **Per-shell working directory** — no process-global state, safe for concurrent use
- **Cancellation + timeout** — kills child process groups within milliseconds
- **Output capture** via sinks — no pipe wrangling
- **Parse-then-execute** — inspect the AST between parsing and execution
- **Process group isolation** — every child gets `setpgid`; cancellation kills the tree
- **Fork-free command substitution** — `$(echo ...)` runs in-process, 3.6x faster than dash
- **External command handler** — plug in your own process spawner for sandboxing or job control
- **Interactive shell primitives** — `tcsetpgrp`, `WUNTRACED`, `Stopped` for building interactive shells on top

## Usage

```rust
use epsh::eval::Shell;
use epsh::parser::Parser;
use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex, atomic::{AtomicBool, Ordering}};
use std::path::PathBuf;
use std::time::Duration;

// Builder API — recommended for embedders
let stdout = Arc::new(Mutex::new(Vec::<u8>::new()));
let cancel = Arc::new(AtomicBool::new(false));
let mut shell = Shell::builder()
    .cwd(PathBuf::from("/some/project"))
    .errexit(true)
    .pipefail(true)
    .stdout_sink(stdout.clone())
    .cancel_flag(cancel.clone())
    .timeout(Duration::from_secs(120))
    .build();

// One-shot execution
let exit_code = shell.run_script("cargo test 2>&1");

// Parse once, execute later (for permission checking / AST inspection)
let program = Parser::new("rm -rf /tmp/build").parse().unwrap();
// ... inspect program.commands, check permissions ...
let status = shell.run_program(&program);

// Output capture
let output = String::from_utf8_lossy(&stdout.lock().unwrap());

// Builtin detection (for permission systems)
use epsh::builtins::{is_builtin, BUILTIN_NAMES};
assert!(is_builtin("echo"));
assert!(!is_builtin("rm"));
```

### Building an interactive shell on epsh

epsh deliberately excludes interactive features (prompt, history, line
editing, job control builtins). However, it provides the minimal primitives
needed for an interactive shell to be built on top:

- **`external_handler`**: Replace the default fork+exec with your own process
  spawner. Your handler receives expanded argv and the complete child environment
  as raw byte pairs, with redirections already applied to file descriptors. The
  environment includes inherited non-shell-name entries, exported variables, and
  prefix assignments. This lets you own the fork/exec/wait cycle for terminal and
  job control without inheriting the embedder's process environment accidentally.

- **`interactive` mode**: When enabled, pipelines call `tcsetpgrp` to give the
  foreground process group the terminal, and `waitpid` uses `WUNTRACED` to
  detect stopped processes. `ShellError::Stopped { pid, pgid }` propagates up
  with the pipeline's process group ID, so you can save the job and resume it
  later with `kill(pgid, SIGCONT)` + `tcsetpgrp`.

- **`BUILTIN_NAMES`** / **`is_builtin()`**: For command-word coloring and
  completion in the prompt.

Everything else — prompt rendering, line editing, history, `fg`/`bg`/`jobs`
builtins, signal mask management — is the interactive shell's responsibility.
epsh handles parsing, expansion, control flow, builtins, and redirections.

## Shell terminology

- A token is a lexical unit. A shell word is an unexpanded sequence of word
  parts; a field is an argument produced after expansion.
- A simple command has assignments, a command name, arguments, and redirections.
- A pipeline joins commands with `|`. An AND-OR list uses `&&` or `||`; a
  sequential list uses `;` or a newline. List is the umbrella term.
- Parameter expansion handles `$HOME`; pathname expansion, or globbing, handles
  `*.rs`; command substitution handles `$(...)` and backticks.
- A builtin runs in the shell. An external command runs through the configured
  external handler or the default process executor.

The parser and AST support the full epsh language; an embedding application may
intentionally expose a narrower contract.

## CLI

```sh
epsh -c 'echo hello'                # run a command string
epsh -o pipefail -c 'false | true'  # enable pipefail
epsh -f -c 'echo /*'                # disable glob expansion

epsh -n script.sh                   # parse only (syntax check)
epsh script.sh                      # run a script file
echo 'echo hello' | epsh            # read from stdin (pipe)
epsh                                # no args + tty → prints usage
```

## Performance

Fork-dominated operations (the typical coding agent workload) are at parity
with dash:

| Operation | vs dash | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| Builtin command substitution | **3.6x faster** | Fork-free `$(echo ...)` |
| Heredocs | **0.8x** | Faster than dash |
| Pipelines | **1.1x** | posix_spawn, exec-direct |
| External commands | **1.1x** | At parity |
| Tight arithmetic loops | **~28x** | String allocation dominated |

## Design

epsh's conformance target is dash, the Debian default `/bin/sh`. The
implementation was built by studying dash's source directly — not by
guessing at POSIX spec wording. Key mechanisms ported from dash:

- Single-pass lexical analysis with syntax-context tracking
- `EV_TESTED` errexit suppression in conditionals and `&&`/`||`
- `in_forked_child` / `ev_exit` to prevent double-fork and enable exec-direct
- Heredoc body reading at newlines (not at parse time)
- `$((..))` arithmetic with short-circuit `noeval` for ternary/logical ops
- CTLESC escape marker for preserving backslash semantics through expansion
- PUA-based byte encoding for non-UTF-8 data preservation

Where we diverged from dash: typed AST instead of control-character strings,
`Result<T, ShellError>` instead of setjmp/longjmp, `ExitStatus` newtype
with private field and type-safe methods.

## Not implemented (by design)

These live in the interactive shell layer, not in epsh:

- Job control builtins (`fg`, `bg`, `jobs`) — use `external_handler` + `Stopped`
- Prompt, history, line editing — use rustyline/reedline/etc.
- Aliases
- Here-strings (`<<<`), extended globs, arrays, `typeset`, `select`
